# curinga-maia

I really like the Manjaro's Maia colorscheme, and in partigular the dark "nokto" variant. But it hase a few issues i deciede to address with this... fork?

First of all, it's not always easy to read, and it often doesn't distinguish between dark and light colors. I played around a bit with a color selector until I found some that I liked.
Second, it's not available for all programs I use and the Xresources isn't exactly the cleanest of configuration files. I am lazy, so I will use this repository to save my colorcheme in ways each application can undertand.

## Why Curinga?
Well, it's the name of my hometown and this theme makes me feel at home in may system. Not a great story, I know, but it's just a name.
